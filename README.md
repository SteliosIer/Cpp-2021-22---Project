# Cpp-2021-22---Project
Project for the C++ Course at Athens University of Economics and Business during winter of 2021/22.

GOAL
Create a simple one player game with marvel cards, using the sgg library. You have to guess the score of each card and select the card with bigger score than the opponent's. The player who has no cards left looses the game and the other player wins.
